Design Document: Smart Parking Management System1. Project OverviewThis system is designed to manage vehicle parking across multiple zones and areas using efficient Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The core focus is on modularity, allowing for easy expansion of the city's parking capacity.2. Data Structures & LogicTo satisfy the project requirements without using external libraries, we implemented the following structures:A. Organizational Hierarchy (Arrays)Zones & Areas: We used fixed-size arrays to represent the physical layout (3 Zones, 5 Areas per Zone, 10 Slots per Area).Complexity: This allows for $O(1)$ access to specific zones while maintaining a clear structural hierarchy.B. Rollback System (Stack)Implementation: A Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out) was implemented in the RollbackManager to handle the "Undo" feature.Logic: Every successful allocation is "pushed" onto the stack. When an undo is requested, the system "pops" the most recent action, updates the ParkingSlot to available, and changes the ParkingRequest state to CANCELLED.C. History Tracking (Linked List)Implementation: A Singly Linked List was used in ParkingHistory to store every processed request.Advantage: Unlike an array, the linked list allows the history log to grow dynamically as cars enter and leave the system without wasting memory up front.3. Allocation StrategyThe AllocationEngine follows a specific priority search:Preferred Zone: The system first searches all 5 areas within the user's requested zone.Cross-Zone Search: If the preferred zone is full, the engine automatically searches other zones to ensure the vehicle is parked if any spot exists in the city.4. Test Results & VerificationBased on our final execution in the terminal, the system verified the following:Successful Parking: CAR-001 and CAR-002 were assigned unique slot IDs.Area Overflow: When Area 1 filled up, the system correctly transitioned to Area 2 (e.g., Z1_A1_10 to Z1_A2_1).Undo Functionality: The system successfully rolled back the last allocation, freeing the slot for future use.History Analytics: The system accurately counted 13 total processed requests using the linked list traversal.
